# Publish to sites

Static-site dumpyard by Rohit. Repo `rohitIntelo/rohitIntelo.github.io`, branch `main`, served from root at https://rohitintelo.github.io/.

## Add a page

1. Slug: lowercase kebab-case, e.g. `indian-railways-history`.
2. Write self-contained `index.html` (inline CSS/JS, no build, no frameworks; keep any assets inside your folder) to:
   - report → `research/<slug>/index.html` (serves at `/research/<slug>/`)
   - guide → `learning/<slug>/index.html` (serves at `/learning/<slug>/`)
3. Never touch `.nojekyll`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `index.html`, `add-skill.sh`, `skills/`, `research/index.html`, `learning/index.html` (listings regenerate automatically via a GitHub Action). Never commit tokens/secrets.

## Upload (pick the first that applies; never hardcode or commit tokens)

### 1. gh CLI (shell, authenticated — no clone needed)

```sh
CONTENT=$(base64 < /local/path/to/index.html | tr -d '\n')
gh api "repos/rohitIntelo/rohitIntelo.github.io/contents/research/<slug>/index.html" \
  -X PUT -f message="add <slug>" -f branch="main" -f content="$CONTENT"
# updating an existing file: GET the path first for its "sha", then add -f sha="<sha>".
```
Ref: https://cli.github.com/manual/

### 2. GitHub MCP server (installed + authenticated)

Call `create_or_update_file` once per file with owner `rohitIntelo`,
repo `rohitIntelo.github.io`, branch `main`, path `research/<slug>/index.html`
(or `learning/...`), your HTML as `content` (raw text, not base64),
message `add <slug>`. Omit `sha` for new files; for updates fetch it
first via `get_file_contents` (same owner/repo/path, ref `main`).
Ref: https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server

### 3. GitHub REST API (`GITHUB_TOKEN` in env, else ask the human for one)

```sh
CONTENT=$(base64 < /local/path/to/index.html | tr -d '\n')
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/rohitIntelo/rohitIntelo.github.io/contents/research/<slug>/index.html \
  -d "{\"message\":\"add <slug>\",\"content\":\"$CONTENT\",\"branch\":\"main\"}"
# updating an existing file: GET the path first, add its "sha" to the payload.
```
